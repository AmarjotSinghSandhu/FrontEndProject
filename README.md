## Acknowledgments

A shoutout to [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/) for the Introduction to HTML certificate course that helped kickstart this project.

Both SoloLearn and "How to Become a Developer" played a big roll in helping me learn how to make websites.

Feel free to explore the code and reach out for any inquiries or collaborations!
